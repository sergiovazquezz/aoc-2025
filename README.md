# Solutions to Advent of Code 2025

The instructions and input for each problem can be found on the [official website](https://adventofcode.com/). \
I strongly encourage you try to solve them by yourself before checking or running any of the provided solutions.

## Roadmap

- Day 1: Part 1 and 2.
- Day 3: Part 1.

## Requirements

The solutions are developed with Rust, which you will need to [install](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) to run the solutions.

## Setup

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sergiovazquezz/aoc-2025.git

cd aoc-2025/
```

Create the `inputs` folder in the root directory, where the input for the puzzles must be placed

```bash
mkdir inputs
```

The input for each day must follow the pattern below

```bash
day<number>.txt

# Example
aoc-2025/inputs/day1.txt
```

## Usage

Use cargo to run the solution, specifying the day as an argument

```bash
cargo run -r <day number>

# Example for day 2
cargo run -r 2
```
